Docker

1.Docker is a container management service
2.The whole idea of Docker is to to be able to ship applications along with their environment into images.
 Which then can be run anywhere.(Even on Cloud platform e.g AWS)
 
3.Docker image :-In docker image acts as set of instructions to build container.(Like template)
	
	Image can be built OR downloaded (From dockerhub)
	Once  you have image. You run it you  get container.
	Once  you run the container you get the  O/P

4.Docker container :- It is running  instance of a image 


How to create our own image?
1) We need to create a file called as - "Dockerfile"


e.g. To Run Java application

Jdk + application + OS=Image 

Provided - Docker is installed on that machine.
------------------------------
 There are commands to manage images and container.
 
 Command for managing images :- 
 1)docker image ls (This command shows all the images avaliable locally
 2)docker pull name of the image -(Download the image from dockerhub)
 3)docker container run name 
 4)docker image build -t <imagename> .
